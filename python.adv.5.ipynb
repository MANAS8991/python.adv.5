    "Multiple inheritance refers to the ability of a class to inherit attributes and methods from more than one parent class. In Python, a class can inherit from multiple base classes, allowing it to incorporate features and behavior from each of them.\n",
    "\n",
    "In multiple inheritance, a derived class (also known as a subclass or child class) can inherit attributes and methods from multiple base classes (also known as superclasses or parent classes). This means that the derived class can access and use the attributes and methods defined in each of its parent classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiple inheritance provides a way to combine the functionality of multiple classes into a single class. It allows the derived class to inherit and reuse code from multiple sources, promoting code reuse and modularity. This can be particularly useful when dealing with complex class hierarchies and when there is a need to model real-world relationships that involve multiple aspects or characteristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, multiple inheritance can also introduce challenges and complexities. For example, conflicts may arise if two or more parent classes define methods with the same name. In such cases, the derived class needs to handle the conflict by explicitly specifying which version of the method to use or by providing its own implementation. This is known as method resolution order (MRO) and Python follows a specific algorithm called C3 linearization to determine the order in which the parent classes are searched.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, multiple inheritance is a powerful feature in Python that allows classes to inherit from multiple sources, enabling code reuse and flexibility in class design. It should be used judiciously and with care to manage potential conflicts and maintain code readability."

    "Delegation is a design pattern in object-oriented programming where an object forwards or delegates a specific task or responsibility to another object. Instead of directly performing the task itself, the delegating object passes the responsibility to another object, known as the delegate, which is specialized in handling that particular task.\n",
    "\n",
    "In delegation, the delegating object acts as a middleman or coordinator, allowing the delegate object to perform the task on its behalf. This approach promotes code reuse, modularity, and separation of concerns.\n",
    "\n",
    "The concept of delegation is based on the principle of \"favor composition over inheritance.\" Rather than inheriting behavior from a superclass, an object can delegate specific tasks to other objects that are designed to handle those tasks more effectively. By delegating responsibilities, objects can be composed or combined in flexible ways, enabling better code organization and reducing coupling between objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Delegation is commonly used to achieve code reuse and to implement specific behaviors in a modular and flexible manner. It allows objects to collaborate and work together by dividing complex tasks into smaller, specialized responsibilities. Delegation can be implemented by explicitly passing the responsibility to the delegate object through method calls or by using interfaces or protocols to define the expected behavior of the delegate.\n",
    "\n",

    "Composition is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming that allows objects to be combined or composed together to form more complex objects. It enables the creation of complex structures or systems by assembling simpler objects, promoting code reuse, modularity, and flexibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "In composition, an object contains one or more instances of other objects as its member variables. These member objects, also known as components or parts, are responsible for providing specific functionalities or behaviors to the containing object. The containing object relies on the functionality of its member objects to fulfill its own responsibilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "The relationship between the containing object and its member objects is often referred to as a \"has-a\" relationship. The containing object has a composition relationship with its member objects because it is composed of them. The member objects are not subclasses or specialized versions of the containing object but are separate entities with their own behavior and state.\n",
    "\n",
    "Composition allows objects to collaborate and work together by combining their functionalities. It promotes encapsulation and modular design by separating concerns and responsibilities into smaller, more manageable objects. Changes to the member objects do not directly affect the containing object's interface or behavior, enhancing code maintainability and flexibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "Composition is favored over inheritance in many cases because it allows for more flexible and modular designs. It enables objects to be composed dynamically at runtime and supports greater code reuse through the combination of different components. It also facilitates the creation of complex systems by assembling smaller, reusable objects, leading to more manageable and maintainable codebases."

    "\n",
    "The purpose of pseudoprivate attributes is to provide a way to create class attributes that are intended to be used only within the class itself and its subclasses. By prefixing an attribute with __, Python automatically \"mangles\" the attribute name by adding the _ClassName prefix to it, where ClassName is the name of the class where the attribute is defined. This makes it more difficult for external code to accidentally access or modify the attribute.\n",
